Use this blueprint to train a tailored chatbot model that infers the intent of a customer message based on your custom data. To train this model, provide a training dataset containing a collection of possible messages mapped to their intent.
This blueprint retrains a neural network on the custom dataset, resulting in a trained chatbot model and deployed endpoint to serve as an organization's virtual agent, which detects its customer intents and generates responses accordingly. 
Complete the following steps to train this chatbot model:
1. Click the **Use Blueprint** button. The cnvrg Blueprint Flow page displays.
2. In the flow, click the **S3 Connector** task to display its dialog.
   * Within the **Parameters** tab, provide the following Key-Value pair information:
     - Key: `bucketname` - Value: enter the data bucket name
     - Key: `prefix` - Value: provide the main path where the data folder is located
   * Click the **Advanced** tab to change resources to run the blueprint, as required.
3. Return to the flow and click the **Train** task to display its dialog.
   * Within the **Parameters** tab, provide the S3-Connector path (Value) to the dataset for the `data` Key parameter.
   * Click the **Advanced** tab to change resources to run the blueprint, as required.
4. Click the blue **Run** button.
   The cnvrg software launches the training blueprint as set of experiments, generating a trained chatbot model and deploying it as a new API endpoint.
5. Track the blueprintâ€™s real-time progress in its Experiment page, which displays artifacts such as logs, metrics, hyperparameters, and algorithms.
6. Click the **Serving** tab in the project and locate your endpoint.
7. Complete one or both of the following options:
   * Use the Try it Live section with any text to check the model to infer the intent.
   * Use the bottom integration panel to integrate your API with your code by copying in your code snippet.
A custom model that can infer the intents of customer messages has now been trained and deployed. Click [here](link) for this blueprint's detailed run instructions.
